# Azure-Olist-BigData-Project
This project creates an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline using ADLS Gen2, Azure Data Factory, Databricks, and Synapse. It ingests data from MySQL and HTTPS, stores it in ADLS Gen2, and transforms it in Databricks. MongoDB is used for enrichment at transformation stage. The solution follows Medallion Architecture for raw, transformed, and enriched data.
